                <h2>John Dave S. Galve</h2>
                <h3>
                <p>       I'm a Senior High School Grade 12 student taking up Computer Programming through the Technical Vocational Livelihood Strand in Asian College - Dumaguete Campus. A self-taught artist who excels in school. I have been a working student for atleast 4 months at Qualfon Dumaguete City. Iâ€™m a fast learner, flexible and teachable student. I enjoy singing and drawing. I'm a young athlete enthusiast, both a volleyball and track and field athlete, and I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I practice programming in my spare time and at school.</p>
                <br>
                <p>       As a young programmer, I am passionate about learning and exploring the world of coding. I've been programming since I was in 11th grade, and I've always been fascinated by the power of code to create amazing things.  Studying programming can be fun! Programming is a great way to learn problem-solving skills and develop creative solutions. As a student-athlete, I was passionate about competing against different schools, representing Negros Oriental High School. I was representing Negros Oriental High School (N.O.H.S.) for 4 years straight. I was a leader in the student media organization, helping to shape the future of our campus newspaper.</p>
                <br>
                <p>       I gained valuable skills in writing, communication, and research that I have been able to apply in my future career. I'm a good and humble leader in my junior high school days. Leadership is an important quality to have in life, especially when it comes to being a successful individual. In order to be considered a good leader, one must possess certain qualities that will enable them to influence and motivate others. One of the most important qualities of a leader is having the ability to think creatively and come up with innovative ideas. Leaders must also be able to stay focused on a goal and have the ability to make decisions that are in the best interest of their team or organization. Additionally, they must be able to communicate effectively and listen to the opinions and ideas of others. Finally, a good leader must be a team player and be able to work with others in order to achieve a common goal.</p>
